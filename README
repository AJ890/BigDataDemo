This project contains the demo of the big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Hbase,
Hive, etc.  Instead of using the Cloudera quickstart distribution, which contains the built-in
Hadoop, HBase, etc. but they are outdated versions. For example, with the latest Cloudera quickstart
version that released 3 years ago, and its software versions:

* Hadoop: 2.6.0

* HBase: 1.2.0-cdh5.7.0

* Hive: 1.1.0-cdh5.7.0

...

I tend to build a distributed standalone environment, which each software run lonely in its own container
and all of them can run well together similar than they work in the production environment. We can upgrade
each service easier by upgrade its image version. This project would be the base toolkit for any of my big data project
later. I hope you find it is useful as well and I am willing to support when you have any problem of running the examples in this project,
feel free to submit your ticket!
